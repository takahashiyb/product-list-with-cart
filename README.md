## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vue
- Pinia

### What I learned

Second time working on a challenge using Vue Framework and 1st time using Pinia State Manager. There was a lot I learned from my second time working with Vue, like emit and using multiple attributes with v-bind. Using Pinia seemed simple but there were nuances in going about it that I want to internalize still. Though using Pinia made states a lot more manageable.

### Continued development

Working with Vue and Pinia without intuitively knowing where to apply them had been difficult to apply. Though as the challenge went on, the application of it became repetitive and recognizable. There were parts where so much of the work that had already been done before realizing that it could have been useful there but, I chose not to change it in this exercise. For the upcoming challenges, I hope to recognize these patterns earlier and work it in as I plan for each component and state before putting them into the build.
